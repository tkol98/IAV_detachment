# IAVd_etach

- "Main_IAVdetach.cpp": 
		A 2D model, investigating the motion of a Influenza A virion on a cell surface by simulating the 
		interactions between the virion's hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) and the cell's sialic
		acid (SA). This model focuses on the detachment of virions with changing desialylation rates kd.

- "ligands_equally.xyz": 
		2D ligand grid for a spherical particle of R(radius)= 60 nm with equally/uniformly distributed NA
		(61 Ligands, 48: HA | 13: NA)
- "ligands_R120_equally.xyz": 
		2D ligand grid for a spherical particle of R(radius)= 120 nm with equally/uniformly distributed NA
		(241 Ligands, 190: HA | 51: NA)
